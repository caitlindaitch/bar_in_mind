## Project Feedback:

Technical Requirements: **Preforming**

>Great job implementing a three model CRUD application and using nested resources!

Creativity/Interface: **Excelling**

>Your Interface and CSS is awesome and almost completely responsive. Great job!

Code Quality: **Preforming**

>Your code is overall very clean, indented well, functioning properly, and following Rails best practices. The only reason this isn't exceptional, is due to adding the forms twice and areas where you could further refactor and make your code more DRY

Deployment and Functionality: **Excelling**

>Your deployed version works Great and your app is very functional. Didn't encounter any bugs at all :)

Planning Process/Submission: **Excelling**

>Great planning process and LOVED that you used TDD and RSpec. Awesome job!

| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Technical Requirements          | 0 Models, or partial CRUD on at least 1 model. | At least 1 model incorporates `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` routes, but no associations. | The app contains 2 models, with at least 1 association. At least 1 model is full CRUD. | Includes many well-structured models, and advanced functionality such as authorization, 3rd-party API integration, or other technology not covered in class |
| Creativity and Interface        | Zero or Minimal custom styles or interface. Evidence of scaffolded code | The app is styled and has an interface of value to the end user: it is not just a nav bar and an index page | The app displays a personal spin or creative element through its written language, functionality, purpose, and/or CSS. Submission includes proof of HTML / CSS validation | The app is fully responsive, incorporates outside technologies such as Flexbox.  App incorporates modern UI themes, and adds unique  flair. |
| Code Quality                    | Minimal functional code is present       | Code lacks proper formatting, includes commented out, non-functional code, or otherwise contains major issues of quality (DRY, naming, etc) | Code is well-formatted, well-named, and contains few style / quality issues | No major code quality issues, makes use of Ruby best practices appropriately, and follows techniques such as separation of concerns, abstraction, and encapsulation |
| Deployment and Functionality    | Application is not deployed, and contains minimal functionality | Application contains minimal functionality, but deployment is non-functional, or application contains major errors when used | Application contains no major errors, is deployed correctly, and contains a custom Heroku app name appropriate for the app. | App has advanced functionality that works with minimal errors, and may make use of advanced tools such as APIs, plugins, etc. App may be deployed to a service other than Heroku (e.g. Digital Ocean). |
| Planning / Process / Submission | No submission received, or submission does not contain basic documentation of planning (ERD, wireframes, commit history, etc) | App is submitted, with basic evidence of planning. Documentation exists, but lacks common areas such as setup instructions, description of application functionality and link to deployed application | Submission contains clear evidence of planning, adequate documentation, include all from previous category, as well as additional information such as unsolved issues. | Submission includes everything in previous category, as well as evidence of  planning tools, such as Trello, and, incorporates workflows such as feature branching, code review, github issue / user story tracking, and justification of technical decisions. |
